* Allusion AppImage - AUR Package
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: allusion-appimage---aur-package
  :END:

This is a over-engineered bash script to update PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO for my user submitted and maintaned package installer for Allusion Appimage.

This is not an official installer and it is not maintained by the developers of Allusion.
